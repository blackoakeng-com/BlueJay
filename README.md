BlueJay PIC32MZ MultiBoard
The Black Oak Engineering (BOE) BlueJay PIC32MZ MultiBoard (#BE-BLUJ) goes beyond a 
typical eval or demo board. It is a Single Board Computer (SBC) designed to take on many jobs. It also 
makes a good training tool. It is like a Swiss Army Knife that fits on your pocket (in an ESD bag!). It is 
compact, but still large enough for easy access by human hands. It is based on the popular and widely 
available Microchip PIC32MZ 32 bit processor. It has a wide operating temperature range of -40 to +85 °C 
(-40 to +185 °F). It lends itself well to the development of systems for data acquisition, user interface, 
AI/ML/Edge, IOT, automation, and OEM integration.
